			* bg-0, bg-1, bg-2, bg-3 - set the background color. 0 being the darkest color,
						   and 3 being the lightest color in our color pallete. 
			    - bg-tr - exists to make the background transparent if nesscessary. 
			
			* fg-0, ..., fg-3 - set the foreground color. Use this for text coloring. fg-0 and 
					    bg-0 are the same color. So are the rest of the coresponding 
                                            bg and fg colors. 
			
			* bgh-0, ..., bgh-3 - sets the background color vhen the mouse hovers over the element 

			* fgh-0, ..., fgh-3 - sets the foreground color vhen the mouse hovers over the element 
			
			* my-0, ..., my-3 - will add vertical margins. 0 is no margins. 3 is the largest margin. 
					    Use this to space your content, i.e. add sepparation to your paragraphs.  

			* f-0, ..., f-3 - set the font size. You'll find yourself mostly using f-2. 
		    
			
		    If you wanna use a button, put the .btn class on it. 

		    When you use a link, put a link class on it.

		    <b>Whey protein</b> is a collection of proteins found in whey, a byproduct of cheesemaking. When a coagulant (usually renin) is added to milk, the curds (casein) and whey separate; whey protein is the water-soluble part of milk. As a supplement, it’s sold as dry powders with various levels of processing that affect how concentrated a source of protein they are and how fast they’re absorbed.
		<br>It’s a high quality, well-absorbed source of protein that’s very useful for hitting targeted <b>daily protein goals</b>. Its benefits extend to the benefits of increased protein intake in general, such as augmenting muscle gain in conjunction with resistance training, limiting muscle loss during low-calorie diets, and modestly limiting fat gain during periods of excessive calorie intake. These effects aren’t exclusive to whey protein but it will likely be more effective than most other protein sources <a class="link" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/bariatrics/_documents/nutrition_protein_content_common_foods.pdf">per-gram</a>

			Whey does not harm the liver or kidneys, but it can exacerbate pre-existing damage. People with damaged livers or kidneys should exercise caution when increasing protein intake quickly without the guidance of a doctor.<br>

				<li>Your optimal daily protein intake depends on your weight, goal, and level of physical activity: from 1.2–1.8 g/kg if you’re sedentary all the way up to 3.3 g/kg if you’re trying to minimize fat gain during a bulk. </li>
